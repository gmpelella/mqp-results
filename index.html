<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>Based on the gameplay results gathered from all of our playtesters, it is clear to see that each player had a different experience within the game. Formulating all of the graphs from the collected data revealed just how mixed the results were. In almost every category, player opinions were either quite positive or fairly negative, and the quantitative data was evenly split between higher and lower values. Therefore, as an overall statement, we can assume that our implementation of the game was not the most effective, but that is not to say the visuals did not assist the players in making informed decisions.</p>
<p>Many players were able to progress through the game, although most gameplay sessions ended in a game over. With each successive age, less and less decisions were recorded since more and more players were losing the game and not progressing. During our playtesting sessions, we observed that many first-time playthroughs of the game resulted in a game over within the first few prompts. This seemed to be mostly because the players had a hard time understanding the mechanics of the game within the time limit at first. However, when players restarted the game, in general they got closer to the end, and most players completed the game before the end of each session. Although it was not our original intention when designing the game, Coding Through the Ages ended up requiring several tries to master, and this may suggest that more game balancing was needed.</p>
<p>Going into further detail about each statistic, the hunger statistic distribution remaining relatively the same shape across each age implies that players were able to manage it quite consistently. Once players understood that the hunger bar reaching 0 meant game over, it seems that they kept an eye especially on that hunger bar in the visual and did not let it get too low. As we observed during our playtesting sessions, some players would eat whenever they had food and their hunger was not at the maximum, and others would play a riskier game and let the hunger get really low before spamming the eat() command. The red coloring, positioning,  and relatively fast decrease of the hunger bar may have allowed players to pay attention to the current status of their hunger.</p>
<p>There was much less consistency with the population, military, and science statistics, especially since those values were affected by the decisions chosen by the player. It is difficult to say based on the box-and-whisker plots whether or not the players used the bar visuals to intentionally choose certain stats over others. On average, however, science was quite high for most players while both military and population were varied depending on the decisions made. This could mean either players prioritized science or the decisions in the game favored science too much and were not fully balanced. There were a few possible decisions throughout the game that increased science by a large amount, so it is definitely possible that each player just happened to choose those options without any true intention of increasing science.</p>
<p>We can make a fairly accurate statement about the distribution of security values though. Almost consistently for every player over the course of the game, security was kept in the upper range from 3 - 5. This likely means that the prompts alerting the player to increase security when they were allowed to did indeed work, especially with the blue color coding to differentiate it from the rest of the in-game text. We cannot definitively claim that players understood what keeping security high actually did within the game (especially because several players claimed they didnâ€™t understand it), but they were able to recognize that it was an aspect to keep a close eye on.</p>
