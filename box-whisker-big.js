    document.getElementById("description").innerHTML = "We first wanted to visualize a topic that is common to almost any type of game: how did the players perform? Using all the statistics from each player recorded at the end of each age (except for food, since that was dependent on hunger which we were already recording), we can observe gameplay performance in a large box-and-whiskers plot. The x-axis for the plot represents each age for each statistics, and the y-axis represents the percentage of the total bar that the statistic value was recorded at." +
        "<br><br>Overall, the hunger distribution remains relatively the same across ages. However, it is important to note that the average recorded hunger value at the end of the first age is much higher than the average hunger values at the end of the other ages. In addition to the average recorded hunger value dropping after the first age, the number of collected data points also drops, implying that many playthroughs of the game ended after during the second age. (This is the case with all of the plots.) Finally, although the overall distribution remains roughly the same across each age, there are more outliers with each progressive age, and by the end of the final age, the recorded hunger values are quite varied." +
        "<br><br>The population statistics show quite a different scenario than with hunger. The main takeaway from this plot is that the range of population values grows with each sequential age. Although the average recorded population drops slightly after the first age, it then slightly increases with each age, with the biggest increase being between the second and third ages. Similar to the hunger distribution, the amount of outliers with the population statistic also increases, and about half of the collected population values are outliers by the final age." +
        "<br><br>The distribution for the military statistics is not consistent at all. Unlike with the population statistical distribution where many of the recorded values are clustered together, the military values by the end of the first age are much more spread out. Both the range and average recorded military statistics take a huge dive down by the end of the second age and remain consistently low for the next couple of ages. By the end of the final age, the average military value is extremely low, but the range is so great due to the number of large outliers either at 0% or at 100%. Out of all of the statistics with box-and-whisker plots, military has the greatest range at the end of the final age." +
        "<br><br>The science statistics generate a unique box-and-whiskers plot. This portion may be the most interesting out of them all: the range of science values decreases with each age as almost all of them converge to 100%, and by the final age, the range is very small. The average science value increases by roughly 0.3 over the first few ages and reaches a maximum by the end of the third age. Although there are a few outliers in each age after the first one that have relatively lower science, the plot shows that most playthroughs of the game ended up with almost full science." +
        "<br><br>The last statistic we gathered data on is the player's security levels throughout the game. These particular box-and-whiskers plots are difficult to read. This is primarily due to the fact box and whisker plots are used to visualize continuous data, rather than discrete data. Since the security statistic can only be an integer from 1 to 5, the data is discrete and therefore cannot be described well by a box-and-whiskers plot. A stacked or grouped bar chart would likely show the data in a much more informative way. However, you can still observe in the plot below that players for the most part kept their security high when they had the chance to upgrade, and by the end of the final age most players had a security level in the upper range (3 to 5).";
